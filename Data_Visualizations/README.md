# Data_Visualization
Various efforts at data visualization

These are python data visualization files. 

The AllData folder contains the original data that each of the files uses.

Airport_Locations.py takes data from a .dat file and places them on a map, inreasing or decreasing parts of the RGB values as you go north, south, east and west.

The files in the GUI_Data_Visualization subfolders have *_reset.py files that take a .csv file and translate their data into an SQLite file relevant to its sister file. The *._Rate.py files call these SQLite files to create a gui for the user to see various forms of data.

Please execute these files with a command line or an IDE.
