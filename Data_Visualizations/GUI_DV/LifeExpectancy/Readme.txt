LifeExpectancy_Rate.py takes data from an sqlite file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection related to the number of births and deaths per 1000 people. You can set the range of years the graph plots, set the region the data is taken from, and set whether the data refers to the average lifespan of men, average lifespan of women, or the average lifespan of both.

LifeExpectancy_Reset.py creates an sqlite table out of the original CSV file to make gathering data easier.
