HIV_Rate.py takes data from an sqlite file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection related to the number of births and deaths per 1000 people. You can set the range of years the graph plots, set the region the data is taken from, and set whether you want to know the percentage of women 15+ living with HIV, the prevalence of HIV for everyone ages 15-49, the prevalence of HIV for men ages 15-49, the prevalence of HIV for women ages 15-49, and the percentage of people with antiretroviral therapy coverage.

HIV_Reset.py creates an sqlite table out of the original CSV file to make gathering data easier.

Data taken from http://data.worldbank.org/topic/health
