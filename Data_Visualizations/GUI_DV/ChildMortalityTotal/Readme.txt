ChildMortalityTotal_Rate.py takes data from a CSV file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection relating to the total number of child deaths a region has in a year. You can set the range of years the graph plots, set the region the data is taken from, and whether the data refers to the total number of infant deaths, the total number of under-five deaths, and the total number of neonatal deaths.

ChildMortalityTotal_Reset.py creates an sqlite take to make gathering data easier.

Data taken from http://data.worldbank.org/topic/health
