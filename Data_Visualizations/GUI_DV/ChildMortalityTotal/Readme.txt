ChildMortalityTotal_Rate.py takes data from a CSV file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection relating to the total number of child deaths a region has in a year. You can set the range of years the graph plots and set the region the data is taken from.

ChildMortalityTotal_Reset.py creates an sqlite take to make gathering data easier.
