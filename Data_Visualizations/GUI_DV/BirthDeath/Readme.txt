BirthDeath_Rate.py takes data from a CSV file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection related to the number of births and deaths per 1000 people. You can select the birthrate or the death rate, set the range of years the graph plots, and set the region the data is taken from.

BirthDeath_Reset.py creates an sqlite take to make gathering data easier.
