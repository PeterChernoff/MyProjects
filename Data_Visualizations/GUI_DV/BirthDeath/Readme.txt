BirthDeath_Rate.py takes data from a CSV file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection. You can select the birthrate or the death rate per 1000 people, set the range of years the graph plots, and set the region the data is taken from.

BirthDeath_Reset.py creates an sqlite take to make gathering data easier.
