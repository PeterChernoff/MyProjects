BirthDeath_Rate.py data from an sqlite file and plots a bar graph showing various statistics depending on the selection related to the number of births and deaths per 1000 people. You can set the range of years the graph plots, set the region the data is taken from, and set whether you want to view the birthrate or the death rate.

BirthDeath_Reset.py creates an sqlite table out of the original CSV file to make gathering data easier.
