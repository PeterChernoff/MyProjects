This project uses Python 3.4 and above.

This project tracks bike accidents around Montreal from 2006-2010. 

It shows where these accidents take place, marking them on a map of Montreal, and creating circles representing how frequently the occur.

Different parameters can be entered, so it can check between certain times and between certain dates, or excluding certain times and dates.

There is a limit to the number of calls this program can make using the free version.

This project uses the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html), [NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html), [geopy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy), [smopy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/smopy), and [PyQt4](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/installation.html) libraries.

If pip is installed, the user can download the packages by typing:

> pip install [name of package]


This might not work with PyQt4 and may require alternate installation methods. See website for more details.

The [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html) package contains matplotlib, pandas, NumPy and several other libraries.

Some of the libraries used have elements that have been deprecated. WinPython 3.4.4.1 is recommended.
