This project tracks bike accidents around Montreal from 2006-2010. 

It shows where these accidents take place, marking them on a map of Montreal, and creating circles representing how frequently the occur.

Different parameters can be entered, so it can check between certain times and between certain dates, or excluding certain times and dates.

There is a limit to the number of calls this program can make using the free version.
